# netclics - NETCONF <> CLI Conversion System
[![REUSE Compliance Check](https://github.com/orchestron-orchestrator/netclics/actions/workflows/reuse-compliance.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/orchestron-orchestrator/netclics/actions/workflows/reuse-compliance.yml)

NETCLICS converts CLI configuration to NETCONF XML / RESTCONF JSON and vice versa. This is performed by round-tripping the configuration through virtual devices, like crpd (containerized JUNOS) or XRd (containerized IOS XR).
